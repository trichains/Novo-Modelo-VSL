            <p>
                Internet user privacy is of paramount importance to insutrilblog.com and
                our customers. We support the protection of client and consumers’
                privacy rights as a fundamental element of our business. Since personal
                privacy integrity is at the very core of our business, our success
                depends on our ability to maintain the trust of the people viewing our
                products. To this end, we have two overriding policies:
            </p>

            <h3>A. Message Recipient Policy</h3>
            <p>
                Before clients can receive insutrilblog.com messages, advertising or
                promotions, client must have agreed to receive such messages. Any
                recipient may request at any time to be removed from our list, and we
                will comply with that request. In addition, we will thoroughly
                investigate any allegations made by recipients relating to unsolicited
                messages.
            </p>

            <h3>B. You can unsubscribe at any time</h3>

            <p>
                We require that each e-mail message sent out from
                <a href="https://floraslimofficial.com/">FloraSlim's Sales Page</a>
                includes an easy way for subscribers to remove themselves via an
                unsubscribe link. If you wish to stop receiving any of our emails in the
                future.
            </p>

            <h3>C. Definition of Spam</h3>

            <p>
                Spam is unsolicited email sent in bulk. Any promotion, information or
                solicitation that is sent to a person via e-mail without their prior
                consent, where there is no pre-existing relationship between the sender
                and the recipient, is spam.
            </p>

            <h3>D. Examples of Spam</h3>

            <p>
                Any e-mail message that is sent to a recipient who had previously signed
                up to receive newsletters, product information or any other type of bulk
                email but later opted-out by indicating to the sender that they did not
                want to receive additional email, then that email is spam.
